## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

Here’s a glimpse of the technologies I work with:

### 💻 Languages

- **HTML5 & CSS3**: I create responsive, accessible, and visually appealing interfaces.
- **SQL**: I work with SQL databases for managing relational data.

### 🌐 Frontend
- **React.js**: My go-to for building dynamic, single-page applications with reusable components.
- **Redux**: I manage state efficiently in complex applications using Redux.
- **Tailwind CSS**: I design modern and responsive UIs with utility-first CSS.

### 🔧 Backend & DevOps
- **Node.js & Express**: I build RESTful APIs and server-side applications using the power of Node.js and Express.
- **MongoDB**: I work with MongoDB for handling large datasets in NoSQL environments.
- **Docker**: I containerize applications for better portability and deployment.
- **Kubernetes**: I’m learning how to manage containerized applications with Kubernetes.
- **AWS (EC2, S3)**: I have experience deploying applications to AWS and handling cloud infrastructure.

### 🛠️ Tools
- **Git & GitHub**: Version control and collaboration are key to my development process.
- **VSCode**: My code editor of choice, customized with essential extensions for efficient development.
- **Postman**: For API testing and debugging.
- **Jest**: I write unit tests to ensure my applications are reliable and bug-free.
